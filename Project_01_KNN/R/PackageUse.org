write documentation for that R function, with at least two examples of how to
 use it (one for regression, one for binary classification).


** About this Package

** How to use this R Package
#+BEGIN_SRC R
install.packages("testthat")
library(testthat)
#+END_SRC

*** Functions:
- NN1toKmaxPredict is a C++ function interface, that takes several pointers and ...

*** NNLearnCV:
  How to use:
#+BEGIN_SRC c++
C++ Code
#+END_SRC

KNNLearnCV Program interface:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
NNLearnCV<-function(X.mat, Y.vec, max.neighbors=30, fold.vec=NULL, n.folds=5)
#+END_SRC



Using the ElemStatLearn::prostate library to show how to use the NNLearnCV function implemented:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
Folds <- 3
  MaxNeighbors <- 30
  Local_ZipTrain<- ElemStatLearn::prostate
  print(typeof(ElemStatLearn::prostate))
 
  DataColsStart = 2
  DataColsEnd   = length(Local_ZipTrain[1,])
  LabelCol      = 1
  Rows          = length(Local_ZipTrain[,1])
  
  #accesses first two Rows:
  #Local_SAheart[1:2,]
  #print(Local_ZipTrain[,1])
  
#+END_SRC

  
  
  #Create New Fold Column to hold Fold Values
  Fold.vec <- Random_Folds(Rows,Folds)
  
  
  #Double Folding ? ~still a little confused where to implement the two instances of the Folds
  sanitize_TrainingData(Local_ZipTrain[,DataColsStart:DataColsEnd], Local_ZipTrain[,LabelCol], MaxNeighbors, Fold.vec, Folds)
  #Projected_K = NNLearnCV(Local_ZipTrain[,DataColsStart:DataColsEnd], Local_ZipTrain[,LabelCol], MaxNeighbors, Fold.vec, Folds)
  

*** NN1toKmaxPredict:
  NN1toKmaxPredict <- function(
    - TrainingInput,
    - TrainingLabel,
    - Neighbors,
    - TestInput,
    - TestPrediction
    )

**** Returns:
  - X.mat, y.vec: training data.
  - train.loss.mat, validation.loss.mat (matrices of loss values for each fold and number of neighbors).
  - train.loss.vec, validation.loss.vec (vectors with max.neighbors elements: mean loss over all folds).
  - selected.neighbors (number of neighbors selected by minimizing the mean validation loss).
  - predict(testX.mat), a function that takes a matrix of inputs/features and returns a vector of predictions. It should check the type/dimension of testX.mat and stop() with an informative error message if there are any issues.

**** HowToUse:


**** Notes/Conserns:

- while working on this project it took me a while to figure out
